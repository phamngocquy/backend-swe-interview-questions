# Topic: SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

## DDD. What is DDD?

DDD stands for Domain-Driven Design. It is a design approach that models software as close as possible with the domain knowledge provided by domain experts.

## 2 base foundations of DDD

2 base foundations of DDD are ubiquitous languages and model-driven design.

- Ubiquitous language is a dictionary that describes things to create a common understanding between team and domain expert. That includes names of all classes, names of all services, rules that software needs to follow...

- Model-driven design is a design approach that focuses on data models. Model-driven design contains a few key components like:

  - Entity: is the thing that is identical and its identity is immutable.
  - Value object: is the thing that we care only about its value and don't care about its identity.
  - Service: is the thing that its behavior does not belong to any entity.
  - Module: domain model is divided into smaller modules to be easier to develop and maintain.
  - Aggregate: is the thing that groups several things into a united block, and this block communicates with the outside world through the aggregate root.
  - Factory: is the thing that creates complicated things.
  - Repository: is the thing that refers to entities and has methods to create, update, delete, read... entities.

## TDD. What is TDD?

TDD (Test Driven Development) is a programming approach where we write the tests first before implementing for every small functionality of an application. The tests would fail since there was no code is written. Then you start writing the code to make tests pass.

It provides some benefits during the development, like ensuring the application is written for testability and improving the test coverage. The tests themself can serve as living documentation on how the functionality is used.

The steps to follow when using TDD:

1. Write the test
2. Make it fail
3. Change the code to make it pass
4. Refactoring and repeat

## What is BDD?

BDD, Behaviour-Driven Development, is a _agile software development process_ that encourages collaboration among developers, quality assurance testers, and customer representatives in a software project. BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially when the "problem space" of the business problem to solve is complex.

Each user story should, in some way, follow the following structure:

```
Title
  An explicit title.
Narrative
  A short introductory section with the following structure:
  As a: the person or role who will benefit from the feature;
  I want: the feature;
  so that: the benefit or value of the feature.
Acceptance criteria
  A description of each specific scenario of the narrative with the following structure:
  Given: the initial context at the beginning of the scenario, in one or more clauses;
  When: the event that triggers the scenario;
  Then: the expected outcome, in one or more clauses.
```
